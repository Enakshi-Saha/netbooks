    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will learn how to infer OTTER gene regulatory networks from gene expression data with netZooR. It is an adaptation of the PANDA tutorial written by Camila Lopes-Ramos.\n",
    "We will focus on two examples: (1) the LCL cell line and (2) whole blood samples from the GTEx gene expression data. OTTER has been developed from a machine learning perspective in close analogy to PANDA.\n",
    "For this reason, we will follow the same steps as in the respective tutorial for PANDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will build one regulatory network for LCL cell line samples and one for whole blood samples. Next, we will compare the two networks by a pathway enrichment analysis for differentially targeted genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell lines are an essential tool in biomedical research and are often used as surrogates for tissues. LCLs (obtained from the transformation of B cells present in whole blood) are among the most widely used continuous cell lines with the ability to proliferate indefinitely. By comparing the regulatory networks of LCL cell lines with its tissue of origin (whole blood), we find that LCLs exhibit large changes in their patterns of transcription factor regulation, specifically a loss of repressive transcription factor targeting of cell cycle genes.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Background of OTTER\n",
    "OTTER (Optimize to Estimate Regulation) is a general method to infer a bipartite network $W$ from noisy observations of its projections $WW^T$ and $W^TW$. It is explained in detail in the accompanying publication https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.23.167999v2.\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are particularly interested in constructing a gene regulatory network $W$ between transcription factors (TFs) and genes. Higher link weights are associated with a higher probability of TFs binding to the promoter region of a gene. \n",
    "![Inference of a bipartite gene regulatory network between transcription factors (TFs) and genes.](https://netzoo.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/netZooR/tutorial_datasets/genereg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "OTTER requires the following inputs: (1) a correlation matrix $C$, which is based on gene expression data, (2) protein-protein interactions represented by the matrix $P$, and (3) an initial guess $W_0$ of $W$, which we base on TF binding motifs.\n",
    "Feel free to play with other choices of $C$, $P$, and $W_0$ as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "OTTER solves the following optimization problem with ADAM gradient descent:\n",
    "$$\\min_W \\frac{(1-\\lambda)}{4}\\Vert WW^T - \\tilde{P} \\Vert^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{4} \\Vert W^TW - C \\Vert^2 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2} \\Vert W \\Vert^2,$$\n",
    "which links transformed protein-protein interactions $\\tilde{P} = P+2.2$ and the gene expression correlation matrix $C$ with the projections of the unknown gene regulatory network $W$. \n",
    "![OTTER infers the gene regulatory network W assuming that P and C are its (noise corrupted) projections.](https://netzoo.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/netZooR/tutorial_datasets/BipartiteProjections.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is an iterative optimization method, which needs to be initialized. OTTER starts from $\\tilde{P}W_0$, as this choice defines the current state-of-the-art in gene regulatory network inference based on gene expression data (see the original paper).\n",
    "The transformation $\\tilde{P}W_0$ assumes that binding events to genes with a high number of TF bindings sites are more likely. More details can be found in the original paper. "

    "## OTTER parameters\n",
    "The success of OTTER depends greatly on the right choice of parameters. Some parameters are related to the OTTER objective, while others refer to the ADAM gradient descent approach. If we want to call OTTER with the original parameters that have been tuned to infer gene regulatory networks for breast cancer and cervix cancer tissues (see original paper), we can simply call the otter function as $W <- otter(W_0,P,C)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets the original parameters to $\\lambda = 0.0035, \\gamma = 0.335, Iter = 32, \\eta = 0.00001, bexp = 1$, where $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ is a tuning parameter in the OTTER objective that decides how much importance we give to matching $C$ or $\\tilde{P}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\gamma \\geq 0$ is a regularization parameter in the OTTER objective, which corrects for high noise in $\\tilde{P}$ and $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters $Iter = 32, \\eta = 0.00001, bexp = 1$ refer to the gradient descent procedure, where $Iter$ controls the number of gradient steps, $\\eta$ the stepsize, and $bexp$ the exponential decay of the stepsize.\n",
    "In the examples that we study next, we will only use the default parameters for simplicity."

    "Let's start with $P$ and $W_0$ and locate our ppi data (to construct P) and motif priors (for W_0). The ppi represents physical interactions between transcription factor proteins, and is an undirected network. The transcription factor motif prior represents putative regulation events where a transcription factor binds in the promotor of a gene to regulate its expression, as predicted by the presence of transcription factor binding motifs in the promotor region of the gene. The motif prior is thus a directed bipartite network linking transcription factors to their predicted gene targets. These are small example priors for the purposes of demonstrating this method. A complete set of priors by species can be downloaded from: https://sites.google.com/a/channing.harvard.edu/kimberlyglass/tools/resources\n",
