The baseline network consists of two groups that are strongly connected to each other, whereas the perturbed network has weaker connections between the two groups. The two groups consist of nodes {A1-A10,B1-B40} and {A11-A20,B41-B80}. Contrasting the two networks using ALPACA identifies these two groups as being the modules that best characterize the perturbation.\n",
