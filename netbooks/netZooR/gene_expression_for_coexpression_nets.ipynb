    "Gene expression is used as an input for several [network zoo](netzoo.github.io) GRN inference tools to inform about context-specific regulation. Gene expression data is used mainly to build the coexpression matrix input, therefore there are some essential considerations to be taken into acount for this specific task.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will go through the data processing pipeline of TCGA<sup>1</sup> gene expression provided by [Recount2](https://jhubiostatistics.shinyapps.io/recount/)<sup>2</sup>. The Recount project analyzed gene expression data from large project such as TCGA and GTEx<sup>3</sup> using a uniform pipeline, which makes it easier to control for variation due to the mapping method. Our analysis will consider the KRCC (Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma) subtype of the kidney cancer.\n",

    "## 2.5. Normalize between-sample counts using DESeq2\n",
    "Now that we have a filtered count matrix, perhaps the most imporant step is deciding on the normalization method. There are two families of normalizations: between-sample normalization and within-sample normalization. Within-sample normalization is useful to quantify gene expression and compare the expression of genes within the sample sample. TO do so, we need to take into account gene length and total number of mapped reads which are corrected for by scaling the counts by the total reads number, computing RPKM<sup>4</sup> or TPM<sup>5</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we are interested in making inference about gene expression between samples or groups of samples such as in a case versus control setting, we need between-sample normalization mehtods. This is usually the case for differential gene expression analysis, clustering, and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our specific case, we are using gene expression to build a coexpression matrix that we will use as an input to [netzoo](netzoo.github.io) tools. Intuitively, since we are computing the correlation between two genes across several samples, we need to normalize between samples. In other words, the features of the genes such length and proportion of reads coverd do not have an effect since they are the same across all samples. We can see this more clearly when we consider the following formula for the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "r = \\frac{Z_{X}Z_{Y}}{n}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    ", where $X$ and $Y$ are two gene expression vectors across $n$ samples, $Z_{X}$ and $Z_{Y}$ are z-scored $X$ and $Y$, and $r$ is the PCC between $X$ and $Y$. We see that, owing to the definition of a z-score, we need to be able to do between-sample comparisons rather than within-sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Variance Stabilisation Transform (VST)<sup>6</sup> method to do between-sample normalization. This method is available through the DESeq2<sup>7</sup> package. VST allows to reduce the dependence between the mean and the variance for gene expression data. By ensuring the homoscedasticity of the gene expression samples, VST reduces the sample-induced variance and allows to compare the samples between them. Other methods such as rlog<sup>7</sup>, and edgeR's TMM<sup>8</sup> allow to correct for sample-specific variance and qsmooth<sup>9</sup> which is particularly interesting for correcting between-sample variation but keeping the between-group differences in a case versus control setting."
