    "## Introduction\n",
    "The CONDOR<sup>1</sup> method is an implementation of the brim algorithm<sup>2</sup> for the analysis of bipartite networks. The purpose of this algorithm is to find a community structure in bipartite networks that takes into account the bipartite structure of the network as opposed to using the network as if it did not have an extra structure.\n",
    "This algorithm was first described in the paper \"Modularity and community detection in bipartite networks\" by Michael J. Barber<sup>2</sup>. The python implementation of CONDOR is based on the R version presented in the paper \"Bipartite Community Structure of eQTLs\" by John Platig , Peter J. Castaldi, Dawn DeMeo, John Quackenbush<sup>2</sup>."
