    "## Introduction to version control with GIT and GitHub\n",
    "Marouen Ben Guebila<sup>1</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>1</sup> Department of Biostatistics, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA.\n",
    "![image.png](static/gitandgithub.jpg)\n",
    "### Why version control?\n",
    "Working on any project (software or documents like thesis or book, etc..) implicitly involves versioning. Whether we do it consciously by keeping track of the different versions of a document as we iterate and refine our ideas, versioning is really embedded in all projects. \n",
    "However, keeping track of the different versions, going back to the last one that worked or merging them can become quickly cumbersome and even result in errors. The anecdotal \"project_finally_final_v2\"-type of document titles shows the challenges of keeping up with our projects as they develop. If there are more than one person working on a project, the probability of making errors by confusing versions quickly apporaches one.\n",
    "Therefore, version control was invented to keep track of the version of any document, without having to duplicate any copies and giving them different names and store them in different folders. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is GIT?\n",
    "[GIT](https://git-scm.com/) implements version control simply by saving the changes that were made between two versions of a document. For example, if my document `notebook` contains the following string \"Hello World!\" and I decide to modify it to \"Hello Planet!\" then instead of producing a different document `notebook_v2`, GIT allows to keep the same document and save its previous state. This way, we can go back to the previous version, if we think that after all \"Hello World!\" sounds much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "GIT is particularly efficient because it does not save the entire document every time we asked it to, instead it save the changes that were made to the last version. In our example, GIT will save in its history that \"World\" was modified by \"Planet\" between the two versions and discard any information about \"Hello \" and \"!\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to do that, GIT needs access to clear text docuemnts such as code or plain text files such `.txt` or markdown `.md`. GIT cannot access binary files such as PDF, `.docx` Word documents, images, or videos. Therefore, it won't be able to tell the differences between two versions of an image or a PDF files and it will consider each version as a new file and save the whole file in its history. In other words, for each version of the document, GIT will save the whole file, which can take up a lot of space and we end up doing the same as copying our documents in new folders. So GIT helps save disk space as well!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why GIT?\n",
    "GIT allows manipulating the history of our projects in so many ways. As we saw previously, we can start keeping track of a versions of a document without having to save the document each time. As a result of this, we can also revert back to any version, if for example in the case of code, the current version does not compile anymore. We can also try adding new features to our software and merging them to our main code if we like them or discard them otherwise. This is enabled in GIT by creating `branches`, with each branch carrying a feature we want to test or generally a direction of our project that we want to explore but we aren't sure of the outcome, so we don't want to modify the main code. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Branches\n",
    "For example, a shoe manufacturer asks a developer to create and deploy a website. The developer creates the website in the main branch. Later on, the company asks the developer to create a price list for Black Friday sales. The developer knows that this page will be up only a few days per years so they create a new branch called Black Friday that contains a version of the website that has the specific sales. After the end of the sales period, the developer reverts to the main branch of the website for the usual operations. If the company decides that they will align the usual prices on Black Friday sales all year long, the developer can merge the Black Friday branch into the main branch to obtain the expected result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Working together\n",
    "Perhaps, the most powerful feature of GIT is that it enables collaborative development of projects as it enables several developer to work on the same project, which is nearly impossible without GIT. For example, developer A works on the home page of a website and developer B works on the contact page. They can both `merge` their work to produce a project that stands as a complete unit and each one of them can `pull` the latest contribution of their colleague to their workspace. For example, developer A writes \"Hello\" and developer B writes \"World!\". Merging both versions of the document produces \"Hello World!\".\n",
    "Obviously, if the developers are working on the same portions of the projects, conflicts may arise and GIT helps detecting and resolving them.  \n",
    "For example, a conflict emerges if developer A writes \"Hello World!\" and developer B write \"Hello Planet!\". When merging both versions, GIT detects the discrepency and suggests that a conflict between \"World\" and \"Planet\" has to be resolved before producing a merged version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, GIT is always paired with a server provider such as [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/), and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/). Although GIT is free, using these server is not. Most of the server providers do not charge for open-source projects and public projects. However, for private projects, a subscription has to be purchased.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open-source development\n",
    "With such an architecture being deployed in the interent, GIT allowed the rapid development of open-source projects where passionate developers, oftentimes volunteers, work together to create a product for the community. Linux, R, Python, Numpy, Scipy, are projects that were enabled by GIT. Perhpas the most important aspect is that anyone, really anyone can contribute to these projects because their source code is available on GitHub and the entire development process is completely transparent and under a free license. In a way, GIT collaborative model allowed to tap into the potential of the entire worldwide community of developers to build code for the good of humanity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A brief history of GIT\n",
    "Nowadays, GIT is used to version code, plain text documents such as Latex and `.txt`, but it has also enabled a development and contribution model that is centered around iterating and refining concepts continuously.\n",
    "Modern open-source projects and startups are developed around iterating code in GIT. Creating a new feature in a product often overlaps with creating a new GIT `branch`, reverting to the latest stable version of a product corresponds to a `git revert`, and starting a new project on the top of an exisiting project is often paired with creating a new git `fork`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of version control was actually invented well before GIT was developed. There were even software such as SVN that implemented version control. However, two factors shaped the incredible success of GIT. First, SVN was often unstable and complicated to manipulate. Second, in 2005, BitKeeper a software that implemented SVN, that was free to use, decided, overnight, to charge users. Linus Torvald, the creator of Linux, stepped in, and developed GIT as a free and far simpler alternative to SVN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GIT and GitHub versioning model\n",
    "Previously we mentioned GIT servers such as GitHub. They are essential in the version control model because they allow to save the project on a remote server, which allows our code to be accessible by others such as collaborators or users, and even for the developers themselves if they connect from a different device, they can always retrieve their project and code from the server through `cloning` the code to the local computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, version control using GIT has 2 components, 1) versioning on the local computer using GIT and 2) storing the changes or the versions periodically into a remote server using GitHub to make them accesible to others or to backup our work in a different location than our computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Installing GIT\n",
    "#### Local computer: Unix systems\n",
    "GIT comes natively with Unix-based OS such as macOs and Ubuntu. To check if GIT is indeed installed, you can check the version by typing the following command."

It is totally fine to copy other people projects and `fork` them, since the whole premise of GIT is to encourage people to build on each other's work.

    "### 8. More on git\n",
    "This is only the beginning of your journey to mastering Git and GitHub. After learning about `add`, `commmit`, and `push`, there are tons of powerful GIT techniques to learn. The next logical step would be to learn about:\n",
    "- `.gitignore`. File managment is an important aspect of GIT. We already saw that we don't want to track binary files, and generally large file systems. Specifying a `.gitignore` file is a convinient way of telling GIT all the files extensions and folders that we don't want to track. Here is an example https://github.com/netZoo/netZooM/blob/master/.gitignore\n",
    "- `branches`. The GIT version graph is certainly linear but it is does not have one path. Branches allow to create copies to test new features and then merge them in the main branch or discard them. It is an easy way to try something quickly without messing up the \"functional\" branch.\n",
    "![image.png](static/branches.png)\n",
    "- `revert`. To go back in time to a previous version.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `stash`. There is actually a third local space in GIT, which is called stash. It holds some sort of cache of the history of the project and it could be used to make `CTRL-Z` type of operations to cancel adding a file for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `conflicts`. Working on large collaborative projects, means developing good conflict resolution practices. Usually thrid party software such as kdiff3 allow to navigate merge conflicts and automate their resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `continuous intergation and testing`. Once we have our code on the server, why not test it every time somone pushes new changes? Imagine that you wrote a function called `mean` that computes the average of 2 numbers and a colleague suggested a faster implementation of your function. Before intergating their suggestion, we want to check that the new `mean` function gives the expected result. Continuous integration allows to embedd unit tests into GitHub through test servers such as [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/), [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/), and [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to perform tests of the form `assert(mean(2,4)==3)` each time a new change is pushed against the main branch."
